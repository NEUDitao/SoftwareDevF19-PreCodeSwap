# We are Implementing a Game of Tsuro

# Folders

  - The directory Planning contains all of the documents describing how we
  designed our implementation of Tsuro
  - The directory Common contains all of the code for our implementation
  - The directory .idea includes some defaults for the editor we chose to use, IntelliJ. Feel free
  to ignore it.

# Project progress

  - analyzing tiles to find all 35 possible rotations

## Tests

  - To run all tests, do ./Test in the Tsuro Directory. This will run all JUnit
    tests
